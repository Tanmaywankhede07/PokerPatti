Online multiplayer game for Android platform. It is based on Indian poker usually called Teenpatti.

# Project Description
This project was made as a internship project for Aspirit Vision Solution Pvt. Ltd.

I mostly worked on the business logic and web service part of the application. Java was used as a native language for the development of the app although kotlin can also be used now. 

Database connection and CRUD operations were deployed as a web service using WCF.
