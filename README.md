# PokerPatti
Online multiplayer game for Android platform. It is based on Indian poker usually called Teenpatti.

## Project Description
This project was made as a internship project for Aspirit Vision Solution Pvt. Ltd.

I mostly worked on the business logic and web service part of the application. Java was used as a native language for the development of the app although kotlin can also be used now. 
Database connection and CRUD operations were deployed as a web service using WCF.
We used Microsoft SQL server as the database and hosted it on the web along with the WCF service.

The animation and graphics for the game was developed using the native android animations such as propery and view animation.
